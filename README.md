# linear_curve_fitting_method
The most common way to fit curves to the data using linear regression is to include polynomial terms, such as squared or cubed predictors. Typically, you choose the model order by the number of bends you need in your line. Each increase in the exponent produces one more bend in the curved fitted line.
